### Statistical Inference Course Project
This repository contains the R markdown files for the two parts of the course project.
The original markdown has excluded all the R code, by using the echo=False option.
The code was committed from the original project report in order to make it short as required.
Here is a version that produces a full report with all the necessary R code.
For each part of the project there are three files:
1. R Markdown file which is modified to reproduce the report, which contains all the R code
2. HTML file of the complete report
3. PDF file with the original report (partial R code) as submitted for the course project
